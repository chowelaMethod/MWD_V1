## 🚨 Executive Summary

Customers don't leave because of price—they leave because Method is **too hard to get working** and **too painful to use daily**. The churn analysis reveals systematic product gaps and workflow friction that drive customers to competitors.

**The Core Problems:**
1. Takes too long to show value (onboarding too hard)
2. Too hard to use daily (clunky UX, slow performance)
3. Can't grow with customers (feature gaps, limited integrations)
