---

## 🎯 THE 5 QUOTES THAT ENCAPSULATE EVERYTHING

### 1. **The Mobile/Field Work Problem**
> "Method has a great integration with QuickBooks, but it is **too clunky and labor intensive for field representatives**. We are a hair color distribution company, and the reps that entered salons every day found **the data entry daunting**. I think Method is better suited for a telemarketing sales operation."

**— crbeautyCo1, $469/mo, 6 months tenure**

**What this tells us**:
- Mobile/field UX is fundamentally broken for daily users
- Too much manual data entry
- Better for desk workers than field teams
- Sales reps won't use it

---

### 2. **The Customization Cost Problem**
> "It doesn't actually do what we were expecting **without having to pay exorbitant fees to get close**."

**— connoilsCo1, $967/mo, 3 months tenure**

**What this tells us**:
- Base product is insufficient
- Customization pricing is a deal-breaker
- Expectations vs. reality mismatch
- Lost $967/month customer in 3 months

---

### 3. **The Feature Gap Problem**
> "**Limited features in CRM, no sales reporting, no dashboards, etc.**"

**— avpro, $1,016/mo, 2 months tenure**

**What this tells us**:

---

### 4. **The Complexity vs. Power Problem**
> "Internal Reason: Daily utilization among the Seatrade team consistently hit 90%+, with an average of 300+ events actioned per day in Q4 2024. The team gave it their full shot, they honestly just could get over **how difficult it was to use the platform for day to day use**.
>
> While customization could solve some workflows, Tim (Champion and Decision-Maker) wanted his team to **adopt the core application before investing in the platform**.
>
> In particular - 3 key areas broke down the relationship:
> 1. Issues with Reference Numbers, duplicating, not generating, overriding one another
> 2. **Difficulties on reporting and how many clicks it took to report** on the information they needed
> 3. WhatsApp integration (where they do most of their communication) was the nail in the coffin"

**— seatradeeurope, $296/mo, 5 months tenure**

**What this tells us**:
- Heavy users (90%+ daily utilization) still found it too difficult
- They WANTED to make it work but couldn't
- Too many clicks to get information
- Core product too hard, customization required before they'd invest more
- Missing modern integrations (WhatsApp)

---

### 5. **The QuickBooks Dependency Problem**
> "**Quickbooks crashed on us so we moved to a new accounting software**."

**— togbatman, $1,735/mo, 10 months tenure**

**What this tells us**:
- When QB fails, Method becomes worthless
- No standalone value proposition
- Platform risk is existential
- Lost highest-value customer ($1,735/mo) due to QB issue

## 🔥 Most Damaging Quotes by Problem Category

### **SLOW PERFORMANCE**

>
> **— ArdenneFarm, $160/mo, 1 month**

> "Not user friendly, especially for sales, especially for tablets. **Slow response time within the app. Frequent white screen issues** throughout the subscription."
>
> **— reliablelift, $320/mo, 26 months**

**Problem**: Performance is a daily pain point that compounds over time.

---

### **QB SYNC ISSUES**

> "We are changing software and no longer will use Method. However, you should know, **it never worked well at all. It was always very unstable and we had to reconnect with QuickBooks many times per day**."
>
> **— pharmacylite, $416/mo, 43 months**

> "QB Sync program usually gave us problems. **I don't think it was your fault. Intuit simply never designed it to work this way** and we understand."
>
> **— mitchellelectronics, $412/mo, 69 months**

**Problem**: Even loyal, understanding customers (43-69 months) couldn't overcome sync reliability issues.

---

### **SALES TEAM REJECTION**

> "Customers sales reps took orders using the sales order screen. Typical orders consisted of 10 or more items and **the screen design was too cumbersome. He needed editable grids**."
>
> **— redithotics, $450/mo, 4 months**

> "It did not work with the flow of our business, **the lack of reporting tools, did not easily allow me to monitor the activities of the sales staff**. A report like 'Sales activities by rep' would have made a big difference."
>
> **— crbeauty1, $315/mo, 7 months**

**Problem**: Sales managers can't monitor their teams, sales reps find it cumbersome.

---

### **CUSTOMIZATION NIGHTMARE**

> "This was a breakdown between us and your supplier. **We've had the subscription for 11 months and still can't use it to quote**. We are closer to customization in Buildertrend after one month. Not contest. We can't continue to pay for something that isn't being tailored to our needs."
>
> **— bedrockroadsllc, $428/mo, 11 months**

> "Method syncs seamlessly but **the customization tool/editor is AWFUL**! I was told I could pay for customization help but I need many things done and **would have cost $10k+ in addition to the subscription**."
>
> **— AmericanFiberPackaging, $320/mo, 28 months**

**Problem**: 11 months and still can't use basic features. Customization costs $10K+ on top of subscription.

---

### **MANUAL DATA ENTRY**

> "In all ways possible, **there was nothing intuitive and all of the data entry was very manual** and we wasted a lot of time and money we could have spent working on our leads, rather than data entry and correction in this tool. Do better."
>
> **— wallpencorp, $342/mo, 6 months**

**Problem**: Manual work kills productivity for teams that need to move fast.

---

### **ONBOARDING FAILURE**

> "Timing does not work well for us at this point. **We had some implementation issues with Method due to a development error that took almost three weeks to correct**. We are heading into our busy season now and our staff does not have enough time to learn Method before we become very busy."
>
> **— MODdisplaysLLC, $320/mo, 2 months**

> "Too many issues with setup and **never really accomplished what was needed in a reasonable time** so we had to seek alternatives"
>
> **— tppinc, $122/mo, 3 months**

**Problem**: Implementation takes too long, loses momentum during busy seasons.

---

### **REPORTING GAPS**

> "Should have **pre-set up reports so admins have access to view all outstanding activities**. It should not be something to get charge by the hour to produce these type of format reports when they're very generic and should be easy enough to offer as standard features."
>
> **— kustomkartpros, $586/mo, 1 month**

> "LRP's partnership with Method spanned nearly seven years, reflecting both product alignment and growing business needs. While Method effectively addressed early pain points around data centralization and project management, **challenges with reporting, email tracking, and Microsoft integrations became more pronounced** as their operations scaled."
>
> **— LRP, $2,392/mo, 78 months**

**Problem**: Even 7-year customers eventually leave due to reporting limitations.
