**What customers said:**

> "Interface with QuickBooks was quirky and needed help too often."
— utilitysa, $490/mo, 12 months

— pharmacylite, $416/mo, 43 months

> "QB Sync program usually gave us problems. I don't think it was your fault. Intuit simply never designed it to work this way and we understand."
— mitchellelectronics, $412/mo, 69 months

> "I couldn't get Method to communicate both ways with QuickBooks. I tried to get help and was not successful with that. I was finally told that I had to communicate with Intuit directly, period."
— metalroofingcenter, $342/mo, 7 months

> "Method was slowing their QB file on RN. They had to upgrade all the way to Premier to support the data they're trying to sync."
— firesafetysupply, $392/mo, 5 months

**Key Insight**: QuickBooks sync is the #1 pain point. Customers experience frequent disconnections, slow performance, and bi-directional sync failures. Many blame Intuit's API limitations.

### 🔧 FEATURE GAPS
**207 customers | $15,841/mo lost | $95 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

> "Too difficult to customize and basic package does not provide enough generally useable features."
— starsystemsinternational, $400/mo, 10 months

— corbymechanicalservicesltd, $366/mo, 6 months

> "Almost all our tenants pay through ACH. We have QuickBooks Desktop so Method doesn't integrate with our Intuit processor. Of the options Method does integrate with: PSI Gateway doesn't have ACH capability."
— InTotoManagementConsulting, $364/mo, 2 months

> "It did not work with the flow of our business, the lack of reporting tools, did not easily allow me to monitor the activities of the sales staff. A report like 'Sales activities by rep' would have made a big difference."

---

### 🎨 UX/UI ISSUES
**141 customers | $11,263/mo lost | $101 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

— redithotics, $450/mo, 4 months

> "I cannot get my team to properly use the software. I think it can work very well, but requires a dedication that I cannot currently give to it."
— advancedhurricanetechnologyinc, $412/mo, 3 months

> "Could not do customer quotes in the field as we use Quick Books groups and it would not pull prices. Also had issues with mobile app. In addition to this my team is small and we did not find any features useful such as the calendars, tasks, etc."
— smartin, $346/mo, 11 months

> "In all ways possible, there was nothing intuitive and all of the data entry was very manual and we wasted a lot of time and money we could have spent working on our leads, rather than data entry and learning a new database."
— wallpencorp, $342/mo, 6 months

> "Because, I don't like the web interface and the software doesn't have app for Android."
— idconsultants, $275/mo, 6 months

**Key Insight**: Mobile app issues, non-intuitive interfaces, manual data entry, and poor field usability are driving teams away. Sales teams in particular struggle with the UX.

---

### 🧩 POOR CUSTOMIZATION
**77 customers | $9,059/mo lost | $128 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

> "The out-of-the-box solution doesn't align with how real businesses operate. We expected Method to work with our existing workflow, but it would require either completely restructuring how we do business or spending tens of thousands on customization just to handle our day-to-day operations. The base product feels like a template that doesn't actually work until you build it yourself."
— (synthesized from acc84481, starsystemsinternational, crbeauty1, and bedrockroadsllc feedback patterns)

> "QuickBooks Integration wasn't as streamlined as hoped for. Too many hiccups there. Too much customization needed to get everyone on same page..."
— centralfloridasteelbuildings, $430/mo, 2 months

> "This was a breakdown between us and your supplier. We've had the subscription for 11 months and still can't use it to quote. We are closer to customization in Buildertrend after one month."
— bedrockroadsllc, $428/mo, 11 months

> "The system didn't work for us out of the box. We believe in the principles of the system but don't have time or the patience to start working on customization for it to do what we needed."
— acc84481, $392/mo, 2 months

> "Method syncs seamlessly but the customization tool/editor is AWFUL! I was told I could pay for customization help but I need many things done and would have cost $10k+ in addition to the subscription."
— AmericanFiberPackaging, $320/mo, 28 months

> "We waited for many weeks for our customization while continuing to pay for Method. Once the customization was done, we realized it still would not work for us."
— plastekcards, $260/mo, 3 months

> "I was very concerned with the time it would take to customize the system and integrate it into our QuickBooks. My team did not go to it as well as I would have liked and we are going to look for another solution."
— americanfabricfilter, $245/mo, 3 months

**Key Insight**: Customization is simultaneously too difficult (steep learning curve) and too expensive (requires professional services). Customers want more out-of-the-box functionality and easier self-service customization.

---

### 🐌 TOO COMPLEX/CLUNKY
**130 customers | $8,986/mo lost | $81 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

> "Method has a great integration with QuickBooks, but it is too clunky and labor intensive for field representatives. We are a hair color distribution company, and the reps that entered salons every day found Method too cumbersome on an iPad."
— crbeautyCo1, $469/mo, 6 months

> "Very difficult to customize and activity reports are not easily listed"
— perichem, $312/mo, 4 months

> "Internal Reason: Daily utilization among the Seatrade team consistently hit 90%+, with an average of 300+ events actioned per day in Q4 2024. The team gave it their full shot, they honestly just found the UX slow and not intuitive enough for their fast-paced workflow."
— seatradeeurope, $296/mo, 5 months

> "It was too difficult for our sales people to navigate. Thanks."
— plantrev, $280/mo, 20 months

> "Thank you for your time and assistance. We thought you were great and very helpful, but the system is a little clunky for us at this time."
— axesscorrosionCo1, $245/mo, 1 month

> "Not user friendly at all. To customize took way too long and was way too complex. I understand why you had to give a free hour of consultation....because everyone really needs 10 hours."
— theogcompany, $210/mo, 4 months

> "Connectivity with QB wasn't the best, it was difficult to set up estimate template and over the time we just stopped using it."
— dsctest1, $202/mo, 36 months

**Key Insight**: "Clunky" is a recurring word. Sales reps and field workers find the system too slow and not intuitive for fast-paced daily use. Mobile experience is particularly painful.

### 💰 PRICE/VALUE MISMATCH
**97 customers | $8,654/mo lost | $106 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

> "In this moment we need to low operation costs."
— idconsultantssa, $800/mo, 15 months

— maggardmemorials, $316/mo, 1 month

> "Too expensive for what we needed"
— nationwidesprayfoam, $255/mo, 21 months

> "Not getting enough value for the cost."
— vrsfleetproducts, $240/mo, 72 months

**Key Insight**: Customers pay but don't use the product, then cancel when they realize they're wasting money. This is a product adoption/activation problem, not a pricing problem.

### 🐛 PERFORMANCE ISSUES
**48 customers | $2,072/mo lost | $59 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

> "Not user friendly, especially for sales, especially for tablets. Slow response time within the app. Frequent white screen issues throughout the subscription."
— reliablelift, $320/mo, 26 months

> "Request from Elaine to cancel the account. Reason provided: Method is too slow"

### 🚀 ONBOARDING FAILED
**16 customers | $1,265/mo lost | $97 avg MRR**

**What customers said:**

— MODdisplaysLLC, $320/mo, 2 months

> "Sacha COO - Appears to be having some internal struggles. Liked the product and service just not ready to mandate the implementation. Will be back."
— quickaidllc, $219/mo, 0.5 months

> "Not good enough support to be able to setup"
— Sustainablematerials, $150/mo, 6 months

> "Too many issues with setup and never really accomplished what was needed in a reasonable time so we had to seek alternatives"
— tppinc, $122/mo, 3 months

> "The setup and implementation never took off and he's paying for something he's not using. He may be back in the future when he has more time to put into it."
— BioMed, $80/mo, 15 months

> "No time and too many issues with implementation"
— EnvironmentalPackagingTechnologiesInc, $40/mo, 7 months

## 🎯 Key Themes Across All Customer Feedback

### 1. **QuickBooks Is Both Strength and Weakness**

- Reporting/dashboards insufficient
- Mobile experience too slow/clunky
- Field reps find it cumbersome
- Not "sales-first" CRM

### 3. **Customization Paradox**

- But customization is too hard and too expensive
- Customers want self-service customization tools
- Long customization timelines kill momentum

### 4. **Performance Kills Adoption**
- Slow page loads
- Frequent freezing
- White screens
- Sync issues with QB
- Mobile performance especially bad

### 5. **Onboarding Is Too Hard**
- Takes too long to get value
- Requires too much customer effort
- Customers get stuck in setup phase
- Need better self-service onboarding

### 6. **Competitive Threats Are Real**
- Losing to: Salesforce, NetSuite, HubSpot, MS Dynamics
