We’ve decided not to proceed with Method, but instead migrate to MS Dynamics with a temporary integrator for a number of reasons. 

 

We intend to move away from QuickBooks accounting in about a year to cloud based accounting, so moving to Method will require yet another CRM migration at that time.  It’s really not worth doing that.  Secondly, the permissions Method offers won’t allow our workforce to be adequately isolated to just their function without paying for a full membership for view only.  Finally, the MS Dynamics platform is significantly cheaper than using Method and QuickBooks together while being fully integrated with our MS365 accounts and systems.  MS Dynamics will give us the integrated platform and analytics we need as a growing business.

They use a Callrail solution for inbound forms and phone leads and that integrates to Method through Zapier.  On Friday I called an issue to their attention when they said they weren’t receiving leads into Method. I researched and found that they had exceeded their monthly Zapier limit and that they were changing Callrail numbers too quickly and Callrail had a notice that some leads may not be tracked which could mean that they also weren’t sent into Zapier to Method.  In both cases it was the client’s responsibility to update their accounts appropriately. Their integration with Method was at 100%.  In fact, I went overboard to do video training walkthroughs and highly customized back end work to meet their needs.  However, in many cases throughout working with the client they missed scheduled meetings, needed multiple trainings on the same issues, did not communicate effectively with each other or with me, and had issues cleaning up their inventory effectively.  My understanding is that they also fired 3 key people during the ramp up. I’ve sent an email to them this morning to clarify why the decision was made to cancel the Method solution because it was working 100%. Regards,Kenny",7.2,381.0

For example - there was an issue where if you leave shipping address blank the Sync engine does not honour the tax status of the customer, and will charge tax no matter what.

Your system adds that function, but is also a production scheduling and probably all the way to MRP II (with complete inventory tracking.... ).

While these are great, and we will likely move to a complete ERP system in the future, we are simply looking to replace that functionality today.

Your system is more than we need - and the costs associated to achieve only what we need exceed the benefit today.

As this is a significantly sized market, and a feeder for future options, perhaps you would consider an option that provides seamless work order integration, with only a product masterfile, that syncs with QuickBooks for sales and billing, without production scheduling (an add-on), inventory management (an add-on), mrp, MRP, or MRPII....

We would pay to replace our CRM (currently FreshSales) with yours, and for integrated work orders, but it would need to be reasonably priced for this market.

Good luck and best!

napanuts3,Difficult Workflows / Workflow Challenges,"In every possible way.
We originally were happy with the free trial and then decided to purchase the year.
Upon activation, we noticed that Method was making changes in our system.  This caused accounts to become unbalanced and for us to have more work to do to repair relationships with customers who noticed changes to thier accounts that put their accounts out of balance.
We worked with Method for months to try to rectify the problems, or at least get an accounting of what changes were made by Method so that we could correct it.  We were only told that they didn't know the cause of the problem.  We continued to look for solutions and Method only agreed to help us if we could leave the sync enabled 24/7.  Since we knew that doing that would continue to harm our business, we tried really hard to work with Method for other solutions.  Eventually the Method support team threw up their hands and refused to take responsibility for any changes made to our accounts.  We sufficiently proved that it wasn't us doing this intentionally, by the way.  
We then requested a refund for the remainder of the unused year which was summarily denied.  We were told that since the causes of the problem were  unknown  and required more harm to our business to figure out the cause, that they would not consider a refund appeal either.
The main reason we picked Method over other CRMs was it's  seamless  integration with Quickbooks.  It more than failed to deliver on its promise, it actually made things worse.",14.8,182.0

advantagecrating,Other - please specify,"Thanks for one hour of free support. 

 

First, I only need one user to start, with a monthly subscription, to prove this will work for us.  We may or may not add users later.  I was told that the minimum subscription is three users.  From what I see online, your website does not state there is a minimum of 3 subscriptions required.  I did not like what seemed to be a sales tactic, and we do not want extra expense – especially while we determine if Method will work for us.  The 14 day trial was not long enough for the determination.

 

Second, I believe that a Packing List or Packing Slip is a simple requirement for many companies – and is a simple form.  I understand that some may want or need to pay for customization, but Quickbooks provides a simple option to print a packing list for every invoice.  It is easy, and it is not complicated to do – even if you just matched the Quickbooks form.  Paying Method approximately $150. per hour to generate a simple Packing List (which Quickbooks already provides), should not cost any extra.

 

Thank You,

Internal Feedback:
Thinks the idea behind Method is great
Found the workflow and navigation throughout Method was a little choppy and not very smooth
They were hoping to achieve the following with customizations;
Create a quote > Convert to a Work Order > Convert in to an Invoice > Automatically create a sign off sheet that they send off to the customer.
They were hoping to do this without many clicks and as much automation as possible
Have a budget of about $2,500
During their Free Hour, they felt like their requests were addressed quickly
When they started their Pay Per Use, they realized that this was going to take a lot longer and more money than they hoped
They felt like there may have been a gap in experience between working with Thomas in their Free Hour and then with Zain in their Pay Per Use. They also said that Zain did a good job setting expectations and with his communication, just the overall investment to bring their requests to reality scared them off
I explained to Carl that we have a new consulting package that may be able to help them with their budget. I am going to send a follow up email speaking to PME vs PPU and see if they would be interested
Carl said to send this over and he will bring this to ownership to see if this is more aligned on what they are hoping for in regards to their budget. If so, they may reinstate their account and move forward with the work",5.5,98.0

With the new customer notes and company calendar in QB 2016, we think that we can do what we need to do directly through QB. Finally, we found your tutorials to be very useful but we could only tolerate listening to Errol in very short bursts - it is not a very professional presentation.

Due to internal delays, work did not begin until late January. While progress was made over several months, the project moved slowly and key recommendations, such as adding more hours to accelerate work, were rejected.

By May, Arnab began testing the solution but grew frustrated with the pace and the limitations of the stock reporting UI, which he felt should not require paid customization. He temporarily canceled, reinstated after leadership discussions, and then raised concerns again in June about app tile issues and billing.

Despite progress shown in a June 5 meeting, Arnab remained unsatisfied with the reporting experience and ultimately chose to cancel his account permanently that evening.",6.8,73.0

dpindsutries,Difficult Workflows / Workflow Challenges,"Their needs: 

Stage 1: Purchase Order: generally where orders come in usually here is where we have to check that their pricing from the pourchase order is correct with our current pricing. Our pricing generally changes once a year and is based on volume. If we could have some sort of pricing rules built in to reflect that, that would be great.
 
Stage 2: Invoice: Usually if there is a price change we then send a final invoice to the customer for approval.

Stage 3: Payment: some of our customers require payment up front, others we bill after the product has shipped.

Stage 4: Custom Printing: some of our products have the option for custom printing. Generally, the process of this goes:

                Customer sends us their logo

                Logo created into a proof

                Send to customer for approval

               Having steps for each of these and even a way to send the proof where they can just click accept or reject with comments, would be great.

Stage 5: Fulfillment: this is where orders are filled in our warehouse

Stage 6: Shipping:  once the order is fulfilled, we are notified it is ready to ship where we then arrange for a truck to come pick it up or if smaller use standard mail to ship it out

Stage 7: Send Bill: if the customer does not require prepayment, we would send the invoice once the product has been shipped.

Discussion:

I explained to Mike that their request would need to be scoped out, and since they had already used their 1 Free Hour, they would need to sign up for the Pay-Per-Use (PPU) service.

- LOVE that it is totally QB driven. It is clear who is and is not a customer.
- Really appreciate that it is a company with whom we had a human being as a contact. And one person. With a name. Who knew what the system did and did not do and was totally clear about it, did not fumfuh or BS.
 
On the negative side (things that are fixable):
- The interface was not totally clear to us as users. How do simply create a user-specific list of contacts, to-do’s, etc., was not clear to us.
 - The lack of a strong interface with Outlook. At least a bcc to Method would have made Method a possibility for us.
 
On the negative side (things that are beyond your control)
- Our users have used salesforce before so it was not “ugh, another new thing?!”
- Salesforce is a highly developed product so it has the outlook interface, the QB link, yada yada. I felt that we were moving to the industry standard, a more defensible decision to my team. (I view our team as my “board of directors” in this.”

TridentSupport,,"While I found the QB integration was very well done with Method, a large amount of our customer interface is via email (using MS Outlook).  I did not find your Outlook integration as well designed as some other CRM solutions ... I am currently evaluating other CRM solutions (including ""Prophet"", which is very tightly integrated with Outlook, although it doesn't have the interface with QB) ... so, for me its a matter of trade-offs ... have a good CRM solution that integrates with how we communicate with customers, or a good CRM solution that integrates with our accounting software ... neither are optimal, but at this point I am looking at the ""communications"" aspect as being more important (with regards to a customer relationship management tool) than accounting.  I thank you for your assistance ... your product is good, but just wasn't the best fit for us.

smilingwoodsyurts,,"Ah, why am I cancelling...
Customer service was very helpful, and the people very nice. However, this is the most difficult and low-functioning CRM I've ever used. The UI is bland and hard to look at all day so I tried to use it as little as possible, which does NOT work for a CRM; there are non-sensical  pathways (far-from intuitive unless you're a developer) and the need for MANY clicks to get basic things done, if you can even find the right button. Data is difficult to manage and access, the customizations are expensive and inaccessible, reports are a joke. 
Not to mention how often we had web-lead errors, and down-time with Google gadget, etc.. 
We gave it a year, and I'm sorry we waited so long to cancel and move on. We spent so much money and time customizing to get the minimal function we did. We also lost dozens of leads to technical errors. Two weeks into a new CRM and everything is clicking, managers are happy, and CRM is fully functional. For example, I built a web-to-lead form and had it up on our website in 1 hour -  by myself!! It took weeks and hundreds of dollars to get so far with Method. 
I think your new version should have been worked on MUCH longer before you released it. It seems like we paid to have you guys finish working out the bugs in it. With the loss of leads and loss of time ($1000s in our time) trying to get this to work, I wish we had charged you instead of paying you.

I would think that there would be an option beyond making leads inactive that could truly delete things or link customers to leads within method.

SIGNET,,"Method does an excellent job of syncing with quickbooks but that is where its effectiveness really drops off. Your business plan to drive revenue by forcing businesses to purchase customization is not friendly or fun. The whole process is frustratingly broken and the CRM is not at all good out of the box compared to other CRM's in the market place at price points far below Method. Other CRM's provide world class support and customization for free as part of the service and the emphasis is on making my job easier not in frustrating me into purchasing customizations. Method is not user friendly, it is slow, and is over priced, and ultimately even though it has perhaps the best integration with quick-books overall its usefulness is far less than other CRM's. Bottom line Method is painful to use. I have enough pain in my day without purchasing it from you guys.For examples of superior CRM's Zoho - super friendly interface and features Vtiger another great CRM for an exceptional price. Ask those guys for anything and they fix it. bi weekly updates that actually include our requests. Biggest failure for Method is the approach.  Im looking for superior support and useability at an affordable price, not roadblocks and additional fees.  Good luck with your model and product.",1.0,

ParkPacificInc,,"Because we are a small company and time is short, we could not fully take advantage of Method the way we wanted.  In order for us to better use Method we needed to significantly customize the screens.  Given I (Jake Jurgenson) was the only one willing or able to take on this task, but still required to accomplish the business related transaction, I was unable to do both.  Thank you for all your time in helping with this, and maybe further down the line we will touch base with Method when time is not as critical.",1.5,
