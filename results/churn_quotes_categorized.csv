While these are great, and we will likely move to a complete ERP system in the future, we are simply looking to replace that functionality today.

Your system is more than we need - and the costs associated to achieve only what we need exceed the benefit today.

As this is a significantly sized market, and a feeder for future options, perhaps you would consider an option that provides seamless work order integration, with only a product masterfile, that syncs with QuickBooks for sales and billing, without production scheduling (an add-on), inventory management (an add-on), mrp, MRP, or MRPII....

We would pay to replace our CRM (currently FreshSales) with yours, and for integrated work orders, but it would need to be reasonably priced for this market.

Good luck and best!

First, I only need one user to start, with a monthly subscription, to prove this will work for us.  We may or may not add users later.  I was told that the minimum subscription is three users.  From what I see online, your website does not state there is a minimum of 3 subscriptions required.  I did not like what seemed to be a sales tactic, and we do not want extra expense – especially while we determine if Method will work for us.  The 14 day trial was not long enough for the determination.

 

Second, I believe that a Packing List or Packing Slip is a simple requirement for many companies – and is a simple form.  I understand that some may want or need to pay for customization, but Quickbooks provides a simple option to print a packing list for every invoice.  It is easy, and it is not complicated to do – even if you just matched the Quickbooks form.  Paying Method approximately $150. per hour to generate a simple Packing List (which Quickbooks already provides), should not cost any extra.

Customer service was very helpful, and the people very nice. However, this is the most difficult and low-functioning CRM I've ever used. The UI is bland and hard to look at all day so I tried to use it as little as possible, which does NOT work for a CRM; there are non-sensical  pathways (far-from intuitive unless you're a developer) and the need for MANY clicks to get basic things done, if you can even find the right button. Data is difficult to manage and access, the customizations are expensive and inaccessible, reports are a joke. 
Not to mention how often we had web-lead errors, and down-time with Google gadget, etc.. 
We gave it a year, and I'm sorry we waited so long to cancel and move on. We spent so much money and time customizing to get the minimal function we did. We also lost dozens of leads to technical errors. Two weeks into a new CRM and everything is clicking, managers are happy, and CRM is fully functional. For example, I built a web-to-lead form and had it up on our website in 1 hour -  by myself!! It took weeks and hundreds of dollars to get so far with Method.

SIGNET,,"Method does an excellent job of syncing with quickbooks but that is where its effectiveness really drops off. Your business plan to drive revenue by forcing businesses to purchase customization is not friendly or fun. The whole process is frustratingly broken and the CRM is not at all good out of the box compared to other CRM's in the market place at price points far below Method. Other CRM's provide world class support and customization for free as part of the service and the emphasis is on making my job easier not in frustrating me into purchasing customizations. Method is not user friendly, it is slow, and is over priced, and ultimately even though it has perhaps the best integration with quick-books overall its usefulness is far less than other CRM's. Bottom line Method is painful to use.
