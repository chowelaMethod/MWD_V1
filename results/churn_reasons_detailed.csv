Thank you so much for the clarification and I apologize for the confusion.  At this time, we do need to cancel our subscription.  We will continue using our current system until we can figure out the issues with integration between our current order system and QuickBooks.  We do still plan to re-visit Method but want to make sure we do our due diligence before diving in head first again.

We’ve decided not to proceed with Method, but instead migrate to MS Dynamics with a temporary integrator for a number of reasons. 

 

We intend to move away from QuickBooks accounting in about a year to cloud based accounting, so moving to Method will require yet another CRM migration at that time.  It’s really not worth doing that.  Secondly, the permissions Method offers won’t allow our workforce to be adequately isolated to just their function without paying for a full membership for view only.  Finally, the MS Dynamics platform is significantly cheaper than using Method and QuickBooks together while being fully integrated with our MS365 accounts and systems.  MS Dynamics will give us the integrated platform and analytics we need as a growing business.

firesafetysupply,Tech Issue - Applications & Sync,I met again with our sales team and unanimously agree Method is not a good fit. There are too many issues to overcome.-----------------Method was slowing their QB file on RN. They had to upgrade all 13 users on RN to deluxe where they were paying ~$50/user/month to RN. His sales team was not happy because when they went to QB everything was very sticky for them. I instantly created a case but they had made a decision already to not continue with Method.

alumission,"Failure to adopt, train, and engage CRM users","Kenny (partner who helped with the account setup) has shared:I’m not exactly sure.  The account was customized 100% to their requirements.  They use a Callrail solution for inbound forms and phone leads and that integrates to Method through Zapier.  On Friday I called an issue to their attention when they said they weren’t receiving leads into Method. I researched and found that they had exceeded their monthly Zapier limit and that they were changing Callrail numbers too quickly and Callrail had a notice that some leads may not be tracked which could mean that they also weren’t sent into Zapier to Method.  In both cases it was the client’s responsibility to update their accounts appropriately. Their integration with Method was at 100%.  In fact, I went overboard to do video training walkthroughs and highly customized back end work to meet their needs.  However, in many cases throughout working with the client they missed scheduled meetings, needed multiple trainings on the same issues, did not communicate effectively with each other or with me, and had issues cleaning up their inventory effectively.  My understanding is that they also fired 3 key people during the ramp up. I’ve sent an email to them this morning to clarify why the decision was made to cancel the Method solution because it was working 100%. Regards,Kenny",7.2,381.0,4.0,5613.0,2022-11-21,2023-06-28

For example - there was an issue where if you leave shipping address blank the Sync engine does not honour the tax status of the customer, and will charge tax no matter what. At the end of the day - they were used to using the QB ecosystem where their data quality didnt matter and they could override the tax, shipping, and discount rates on the fly without following the rules of the sync engine.

Also, your software is a good solution and covers the basics, however, my initial engagement with your consulting group did not make a good impression on me, since I was asking for fixes to the bugs in the system and a few additions to the software that should have been there to begin with, such as account owner field, etc. Every time I got engaged with consulting group, I was offered to pay for another consulting session. This makes your organization more like one that is looking to get additional revenue quickly without emphasis on customer service and relationship building. Some times it is a good thing to establish good faith and trust without charging your clients for basic things that should be offered at no charge. Especially, when the consultants are charging me for one hour, so they can engage in a conversation and explain why the feature is not working or not included. That is simply a poor business practice. Other than that, all is good.",8.6,280.0,7.0,7690.0,2013-01-28,2013-10-17

digitaldesignedsolutions,Difficult to Customize,"Customer stated not working for us. 
The customer was not willing to purchase additional customization to support their workflows. There were two significant deal breakers:

1.) They work with a number of custom items and configurations, not all of these items should live in QuickBooks. In theory they wanted to be able to use Items as (Wait for Sync Approval on estimates) but then convert them to QuickBooks only when the sales was complete.

2.) They had issues with the refernumber not populating on save and did not want to have Method take over numbering.

Customer service, although friendly and courteous, is not easy to work with. Everything is done through email and chats etc. when there are issues, the motto is keep retrying until it works.  ie the cancellation. the link had to be sent to us multiple times before it worked.  this causes frustration to your clients. 

Everything that Method offers can in fact be completed in QB.  there is not point in paying the extra cost when we already have the same capabilities in the main system we are using. I understand there are slight differences but we would rather use our main system and put spending towards a program that allows collaboration with departments that do not need information retrieved from QB.

truebounce3,Other - please specify,"We are a small manufacturing company that lost work orders when moving from QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise to QuickBooks Enterprise Online. There are a lot of us. Your system adds that function, but is also a production scheduling and probably all the way to MRP II (with complete inventory tracking.... ).

While these are great, and we will likely move to a complete ERP system in the future, we are simply looking to replace that functionality today.

Your system is more than we need - and the costs associated to achieve only what we need exceed the benefit today.

As this is a significantly sized market, and a feeder for future options, perhaps you would consider an option that provides seamless work order integration, with only a product masterfile, that syncs with QuickBooks for sales and billing, without production scheduling (an add-on), inventory management (an add-on), mrp, MRP, or MRPII....

We would pay to replace our CRM (currently FreshSales) with yours, and for integrated work orders, but it would need to be reasonably priced for this market.

Good luck and best!

napanuts3,Difficult Workflows / Workflow Challenges,"In every possible way.
We originally were happy with the free trial and then decided to purchase the year.
Upon activation, we noticed that Method was making changes in our system.  This caused accounts to become unbalanced and for us to have more work to do to repair relationships with customers who noticed changes to thier accounts that put their accounts out of balance.
We worked with Method for months to try to rectify the problems, or at least get an accounting of what changes were made by Method so that we could correct it.  We were only told that they didn't know the cause of the problem.  We continued to look for solutions and Method only agreed to help us if we could leave the sync enabled 24/7.  Since we knew that doing that would continue to harm our business, we tried really hard to work with Method for other solutions.  Eventually the Method support team threw up their hands and refused to take responsibility for any changes made to our accounts.  We sufficiently proved that it wasn't us doing this intentionally, by the way.  
We then requested a refund for the remainder of the unused year which was summarily denied.  We were told that since the causes of the problem were  unknown  and required more harm to our business to figure out the cause, that they would not consider a refund appeal either.
The main reason we picked Method over other CRMs was it's  seamless  integration with Quickbooks.  It more than failed to deliver on its promise, it actually made things worse.",14.8,182.0,22.0,4805.0,2022-06-09,2023-09-01

advantagecrating,Other - please specify,"Thanks for one hour of free support. 

 

First, I only need one user to start, with a monthly subscription, to prove this will work for us.  We may or may not add users later.  I was told that the minimum subscription is three users.  From what I see online, your website does not state there is a minimum of 3 subscriptions required.  I did not like what seemed to be a sales tactic, and we do not want extra expense – especially while we determine if Method will work for us.  The 14 day trial was not long enough for the determination.

 

Second, I believe that a Packing List or Packing Slip is a simple requirement for many companies – and is a simple form.  I understand that some may want or need to pay for customization, but Quickbooks provides a simple option to print a packing list for every invoice.  It is easy, and it is not complicated to do – even if you just matched the Quickbooks form.  Paying Method approximately $150. per hour to generate a simple Packing List (which Quickbooks already provides), should not cost any extra.

 

Thank You,

hi5metalfab,Tech Issue - Applications & Sync,"1. They have QB hosted on a server and the method Sync engine as well. For the real-time sync, we have to have the QB open and connected to Method.
2. Their workflow is they have different users going to Single User mode frequently in QBs on their individual side (desktop). So, as we know when any user goes to Single User, other users have to log out.
3. This results in the user currently signed into QB on the server exiting forcefully and thus the sync engine is disconnected.
4. We asked them to install it on a dedicated system where one is working actively at all times and can use it as the Main sync engine. But the conflict is, going to Single User logs out every other user and eventually, it will disconnect sync at that moment.",0.0,159.0,0.0,2.0,2022-11-10,2022-11-11

KineticSolutions,Difficult UI,"We tried Method with our office scheduler and field staff. We received significant feedback that Method was not as intuitive for our service staff as Jobber which is the platform we had been using. My original goal with Method was better integration with QB online but I soon realized and was greatly disappointed that the two-way numbering only works with QB if we have custom transaction numbers turned off. We need to have that ability so we were back to manually having to enter invoice and estimate numbers. All in all, my team demanded the simplicity of Jobber. Out of the box, Jobber meets almost all of our needs and Method would require too much customization to get there. Thank you.",4.6,122.0,6.0,1831.0,2021-04-21,2021-09-09

I built own system using several apps and shopify and other crm also that rout doest charge per user and is less money for scaling into larger sales company. There are some drawbacks like not syncing with quickbooks but there are also other bebefits. Some applications I would have like to see with method much better are the following:  1. Dealer Portal with products they can purchase that syncs with quickbooks. 2. CRM which also shows dealers on MAP so sales people can identify their market and plan sales trips. 3.

------

Internal Feedback:
Thinks the idea behind Method is great
Found the workflow and navigation throughout Method was a little choppy and not very smooth
They were hoping to achieve the following with customizations;
Create a quote > Convert to a Work Order > Convert in to an Invoice > Automatically create a sign off sheet that they send off to the customer.
They were hoping to do this without many clicks and as much automation as possible
Have a budget of about $2,500
During their Free Hour, they felt like their requests were addressed quickly
When they started their Pay Per Use, they realized that this was going to take a lot longer and more money than they hoped
They felt like there may have been a gap in experience between working with Thomas in their Free Hour and then with Zain in their Pay Per Use. They also said that Zain did a good job setting expectations and with his communication, just the overall investment to bring their requests to reality scared them off
I explained to Carl that we have a new consulting package that may be able to help them with their budget. I am going to send a follow up email speaking to PME vs PPU and see if they would be interested
Carl said to send this over and he will bring this to ownership to see if this is more aligned on what they are hoping for in regards to their budget. If so, they may reinstate their account and move forward with the work",5.5,98.0,1.0,672.0,2024-02-29,2024-08-14

Emails back and forth about how to cancel my account. The UX is terrible - looks great but the interaction design isn't thought out at all. The icing on the cake was when I found the actual Cancel button, in light gray, lower right on my screen, below the text about irrelevant things on the page. 

Well, I hope you use these observations to improve the product.",0.2,85.0,0.0,0.0,2024-06-27,2024-07-03

With such a good team in place for customer service, it is a shame that your corporate financial decisionmakers, or whomever thought that was not a reasonable request, should be terminated. 

A no refund policy is one thing, throwing recurring revenue out the window is another.

Also we did not find that the user interface for Method was very user friendly or fast. I strongly suggest that you concentrate on the usability of Method rather than it's flexibility. With the new customer notes and company calendar in QB 2016, we think that we can do what we need to do directly through QB. Finally, we found your tutorials to be very useful but we could only tolerate listening to Errol in very short bursts - it is not a very professional presentation. Maybe Method needs to employ the focus group form of product development. That said, your support has always been excellent and we wish you all the best.

kadakiainternationalinc,Difficult to Customize,"Arnab signed up in November 2024 and began a Dedicated Enhancement Plan in January 2025 with the goal of capturing customer sales data through a custom dashboard. Due to internal delays, work did not begin until late January. While progress was made over several months, the project moved slowly and key recommendations, such as adding more hours to accelerate work, were rejected.

By May, Arnab began testing the solution but grew frustrated with the pace and the limitations of the stock reporting UI, which he felt should not require paid customization. He temporarily canceled, reinstated after leadership discussions, and then raised concerns again in June about app tile issues and billing.

Despite progress shown in a June 5 meeting, Arnab remained unsatisfied with the reporting experience and ultimately chose to cancel his account permanently that evening.",6.8,73.0,15.0,627.0,2024-11-11,2025-06-05

cumberlandcleaningco,Using QuickBooks Only (no other app),"I found a way to get the things that I need through a different app that I m already paying a subscription fee for. The functionality is there with no added costs. Method is an amazing product but I can t justify the extra cost at this stage of our business.

I found a way to customize invoices, estimates and receipts in QuickBooks. This was the main reason that I wanted method, because I thought that QuickBooks didn’t have that functionality. 

If our customer base grows sufficiently then I’ll look into method again.",1.3,61.0,5.0,17.0,2025-05-26,2025-07-05

I was using you primarily for your web to lead feature, to get customer data into quick books, I hated how hard you make it to edit and change that form, I paid to have training on it but instead they just made it for me and didn t even attempt to show me how to do it myself, if that form could feed into quickbooks custom fields I would probably stick with you but at this point Jotform (my current web to lead) can sync to excel and quickbooks giving me the same thing that I wanted from you without the complicated interface.

highfillcustomwoodworks,Other - please specify,"Creating an estimate in Method is extremely lacking.  yes, it pulls the item list from Quickbooks, but the groups and subtotals and % on those subtotals does not appear to work the same.  I absolutely must have an estimate that transfers into QB seamlessly when a contract is signed.  I progress invoice against the estimate.  I also use an over-arching group on every estimate, as I do not reprint the details of the estimate for the customer (my contracts are lump sum, they only see one number and no details of what goes into that number).  

Also, Method seems to be lacking for tracking project life cycle.  ",0.1,49.0,1.0,1021.0,2020-06-25,2020-06-28

I'm sorry to say that we are going to cancel our method subscription.  We really liked its organized layout and ease of use, but we are finding that it was just a bit pre-mature for us to begin using a CRM (any CRM).  We are not utilizing it enough to justify the expense.

We will be back as we grow and add staff.

Thanks,

twoleavesandabud,,"On the good side for Method:
- LOVE that it is totally QB driven. It is clear who is and is not a customer.
- Really appreciate that it is a company with whom we had a human being as a contact. And one person. With a name. Who knew what the system did and did not do and was totally clear about it, did not fumfuh or BS.
 
On the negative side (things that are fixable):
- The interface was not totally clear to us as users. How do simply create a user-specific list of contacts, to-do’s, etc., was not clear to us.
 - The lack of a strong interface with Outlook. At least a bcc to Method would have made Method a possibility for us.
 
On the negative side (things that are beyond your control)
- Our users have used salesforce before so it was not “ugh, another new thing?!”
- Salesforce is a highly developed product so it has the outlook interface, the QB link, yada yada. I felt that we were moving to the industry standard, a more defensible decision to my team. (I view our team as my “board of directors” in this.”
 
I really wish you guys all the best and hope you keep building out a great system. It could easily be that we use it for another of our companies in the future.",3.0,49.0,12.0,923.0,2018-01-30,2018-04-30

-----

Method Comment: Customer was looking to create two different versions of invoices where USD and CAD Prices are shown to users based on their location. This was a limitation of QuickBooks as well as they wanted to control all costs and prices to be CAD and then convert when needed.

dpindsutries,Difficult Workflows / Workflow Challenges,"Their needs: 

Stage 1: Purchase Order: generally where orders come in usually here is where we have to check that their pricing from the pourchase order is correct with our current pricing. Our pricing generally changes once a year and is based on volume. If we could have some sort of pricing rules built in to reflect that, that would be great.
 
Stage 2: Invoice: Usually if there is a price change we then send a final invoice to the customer for approval.

Stage 3: Payment: some of our customers require payment up front, others we bill after the product has shipped.

Stage 4: Custom Printing: some of our products have the option for custom printing. Generally, the process of this goes:

                Customer sends us their logo

                Logo created into a proof

                Send to customer for approval

               Having steps for each of these and even a way to send the proof where they can just click accept or reject with comments, would be great.

Stage 5: Fulfillment: this is where orders are filled in our warehouse

Stage 6: Shipping:  once the order is fulfilled, we are notified it is ready to ship where we then arrange for a truck to come pick it up or if smaller use standard mail to ship it out

Stage 7: Send Bill: if the customer does not require prepayment, we would send the invoice once the product has been shipped.

Discussion:

I explained to Mike that their request would need to be scoped out, and since they had already used their 1 Free Hour, they would need to sign up for the Pay-Per-Use (PPU) service. Unfortunately, they felt that our PPU was too expensive and were unwilling to proceed with it. I clarified our processes to ensure expectations were clear, but they were still dissatisfied with the costs involved in customizing their requirements in Method.",2.0,49.0,36.0,6232.0,2024-09-10,2024-11-10

In reality:

1) Conducted multiple training sessions with Dana and Chris (sales rep) to ensure they understood the product and could succeed with it.
2) She hired and subsequently let go of multiple sales representatives.
3) Needed basic functionality, such as Activities and receiving payments by cheque and cash—features we covered thoroughly during training.
4) Required lead management capabilities but struggled to generate enough leads through her sales team to make the cost of Method CRM worthwhile.",20.4,49.0,4.0,254.0,2023-03-07,2024-11-18

smilingwoodsyurts,,"Ah, why am I cancelling...
Customer service was very helpful, and the people very nice. However, this is the most difficult and low-functioning CRM I've ever used. The UI is bland and hard to look at all day so I tried to use it as little as possible, which does NOT work for a CRM; there are non-sensical  pathways (far-from intuitive unless you're a developer) and the need for MANY clicks to get basic things done, if you can even find the right button. Data is difficult to manage and access, the customizations are expensive and inaccessible, reports are a joke. 
Not to mention how often we had web-lead errors, and down-time with Google gadget, etc.. 
We gave it a year, and I'm sorry we waited so long to cancel and move on. We spent so much money and time customizing to get the minimal function we did. We also lost dozens of leads to technical errors. Two weeks into a new CRM and everything is clicking, managers are happy, and CRM is fully functional. For example, I built a web-to-lead form and had it up on our website in 1 hour -  by myself!! It took weeks and hundreds of dollars to get so far with Method. 
I think your new version should have been worked on MUCH longer before you released it. It seems like we paid to have you guys finish working out the bugs in it. With the loss of leads and loss of time ($1000s in our time) trying to get this to work, I wish we had charged you instead of paying you.
Respectfully, Good luck, guys. ",12.0,35.0,19.0,403.0,2016-01-12,2017-01-12

I imported a spreadsheet wrong and there was nothing the customer service could do to delete the data I had mis-imported. According to him the only way to reset the data that was available in my account was to cancel the entire thing and start over. I find this to be a waste of my time. I would think that there would be an option beyond making leads inactive that could truly delete things or link customers to leads within method. It seems that if you mess up once you are stuck with your mistake for eternity. So I'm deleting this entire account so I can start over and make an entirely new account all over again simply because your program is not particularly user friendly. ,4.6,28.0,0.0,776.0,2019-05-09,2019-09-27

Also, it's not expensive, but the cost is a consideration. I can use a different tool that is free to do the same kind of thing, with less automation, but entering new customers in Quickbooks is not a time-suck for me. 

Finally, the user interface was a little clunky and not easy to follow what I need to do next. I like visual management, so kanban boards and nice dashboards to sum up activities and opportunities. Also, I wish I could track existing customer reorders in the tool.

I regret to inform you that we will not be able to immediately sign up for Method: CRM. Unfortunately during this trial we received word that we may have to switch operating systems that will potentially have its own CRM built in.

 

I personally appreciate your help with our demo and trial time. We will let you know if at a future date we wish to sign up with Method.

 

Thank you!

We are a small distribution company needing more than QB can deliver and have been on a hunt for two years to find an affordable option to replace QB. All of the EPR systems are just too expensive out of the gate.  Methods approach looked like a great option. But once we dove in to the trial we realize Method does not offer even the basic functions of a CRM out of the box, so here we go again with the never ending money pit of customization, just like all the other players in this space. When I discussed this with the sales agent all he could say was you have a free hour of customization.  I was very excited when I first found out about Method and sad it did not work out.

mielemanufacturingofpa,Feature Gap,"Honestly, when this program was pitched to Lou, there were specific things that he was looking for that you guys said you could do (Track Commissions). When I had my 1 hour training session with Shadee the other day she told me that you guys cannot track commissions but for a small fee of $145.00 an hour you could build something for us. The rest of the training session was showing us things that really don’t differ too much from how we are operating right now for free (like using a calendar for reminders and sending messages).

SIGNET,,"Method does an excellent job of syncing with quickbooks but that is where its effectiveness really drops off. Your business plan to drive revenue by forcing businesses to purchase customization is not friendly or fun. The whole process is frustratingly broken and the CRM is not at all good out of the box compared to other CRM's in the market place at price points far below Method. Other CRM's provide world class support and customization for free as part of the service and the emphasis is on making my job easier not in frustrating me into purchasing customizations. Method is not user friendly, it is slow, and is over priced, and ultimately even though it has perhaps the best integration with quick-books overall its usefulness is far less than other CRM's. Bottom line Method is painful to use. I have enough pain in my day without purchasing it from you guys.For examples of superior CRM's Zoho - super friendly interface and features Vtiger another great CRM for an exceptional price. Ask those guys for anything and they fix it. bi weekly updates that actually include our requests. Biggest failure for Method is the approach.  Im looking for superior support and useability at an affordable price, not roadblocks and additional fees.  Good luck with your model and product.",1.0,,3.0,15.0,2014-11-08,2014-12-09
